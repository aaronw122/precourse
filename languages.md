- typed: specifies the type of data that needs to be passed. can
  - can check for compiler errors(i.e. wrong type, unknown variable, etc) during compile time

### What is the difference between a compiled and interpreted language? Is JS compiled or interpreted?
- compiled languages translate source to machine code ahead of time
- interpreted languages execute during runtime that reads source on the fly. 
- JIT compiles frequentlyt executed funcitons into optimized machince code. 
  - that compiled code replaces the slower interpreter path while program is running.
